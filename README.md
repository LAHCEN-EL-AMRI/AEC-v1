# AEC-v1 (Automatic Efficiency Calibration) Software
The AEC software was designed to validate a precise method for calibrating the efficiency of GeHP detectors, detailed in the article “Automatic efficiency calibration method with high precision for GeHP detector”. It offers a graphical interface to manipulate calibration formulas and can be used in addition to other gamma analysis tools.
Currently, AEC integrates five formulas, including one of the new method. Its open source nature allows users to customize the code to add formulas or features tailored to their needs, making it a powerful and flexible tool for various applications.
