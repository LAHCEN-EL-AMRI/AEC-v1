# AEC-v1
The AEC software was designed to validate a precise method for calibrating the efficiency of GeHP detectors, detailed in the article “Automatic efficiency calibration method with high precision for GeHP detector”. It offers a graphical interface to manipulate calibration formulas and can be used in addition to other gamma analysis tools.
