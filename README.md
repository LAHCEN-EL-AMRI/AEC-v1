# AEC-v1 (Automatic Efficiency Calibration) Software
The AEC software was designed to validate a precise method for calibrating the efficiency of GeHP detectors, detailed in the article “Automatic efficiency calibration method with high precision for GeHP detector”. It offers a graphical interface to manipulate calibration formulas and can be used in addition to other gamma analysis tools.
Currently, AEC integrates five formulas, including one of the new method. Its open source nature allows users to customize the code to add formulas or features tailored to their needs, making it a powerful and flexible tool for various applications.

# GUI 

![AEC Software GUI](https://github.com/LAHCEN-EL-AMRI/AEC-v1/blob/main/Fig0.png)

The GUI has been divided into three distinct sections: Buttons Section: Located at the top left of the interface, this section contains the main controls needed to interact with the software. It offers essential functionalities such as loading files containing radionuclides and selecting the appropriate calibration functions. Radionuclide Table Section and Graph Section: Located at the bottom of the interface, this section is dedicated to the visual representation of the results in the form of graphical curves. Users can observe trends, compare experimental data to theoretical curves and check the quality of the calibration performed. The graph is designed to be interactive, offering zoom options for more precise analysis.
